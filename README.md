Food APIs

1) pip install requests requests_oauthlib
2) pip install yelpapi
3) pip install factual-api

I already put the keys into the files, unless you want to make your own. Both the factual-api (official) and yelpapi (unofficial) are wrapper classes over the APIs. I'm going to try and find documentation for the way that these classes work. For the Yelp API, just use the yelp.py file at the root of the repository. For the Factual API, cd into the Factual folder and run factual.py.
